            H2O is short for Haja to Ocean.
            Put succinctly, H2O performs machine learning with <a href='https://haja.io/'>Haja Networks</a>' flagship OrbitDB and <a href='https://oceanprotocol.com/'>Ocean Protocol</a>'s data markets.
            <br><br>
            H2O is the first app to run in the convergence stack, building on top of multiple software frameworks that underpin the <a href='/building/'>Convergence Ecosystem</a>.
            It is a demonstration of machine learning in Web3, allowing users to run a clustering algorithm on data stored in OrbitDB and publish the resulting AI datasets to the Ocean Protocol blockchain.
            <br><br>
            H2O makes use of various technologies, including Python, Node and Angular.
            The app runs the Ocean Protocol Trilobite release code and latest OrbitDB.
            OrbitDB, H2O's core data store, is a peer-to-peer distributed database for <a href='https://ipfs.io/'>IPFS</a>.
            A separate component, H2O-Host, has also been created so that developers can upload their own datasets to OrbitDB, as well as generate datasets for testing purposes.
            <br><br>
            To demonstrate how OrbitDB is a functional, ready-to-use tool in the convergence ecosystem, H2O allows the user to enter an OrbitDB address of their choosing.
            The app plots the dataset, with the user able to specify the number of clusters the algorithm should aim for.
            H2O will parse any two-dimensional set of points using K-means, a popular and efficient clustering method.
            The clustered output is also plotted for the user to see.
            <br><br>
            Once the algorithm has run, datasets can be published to Ocean Protocol.
            This is achieved using Ocean Protocol’s Squid API for Python.
            H2O has built-in support for Azure hosting, the current standard for Ocean Protocol, as well as provides proof-of-concept hosting using OrbitDB for developers.
            <br><br>
            H2O is able to generate useful preprocessed datasets for AI and use them to seed Ocean Protocol’s global data market, all on a decentralised storage solution made possible by Haja Networks.
            Though it is largely demonstrative for now, H2O is the first step toward apps in the convergence ecosystem.
